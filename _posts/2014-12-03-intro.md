# Ethics & Algorithms Toolkit
{: .text-purple}

Government bodies that implement algorithms are facing increasing pressure from the public, the media, and academic institutions to be more transparent and accountable about their use. Stories are coming out every day describing the unintended or undesirable consequences of algorithms, but governments do not have the tools they need to understand and manage this new class of risk. The City of San Francisco, GovEx, Harvard DataSmart and Data Community DC have collaborated to develop a hands-on tool for cities to use to help them understand the implications of using an algorithm, clearly articulate the potential risks, and identify ways to mitigate them.

*The question isnâ€™t about whether you should be doing this, but when you are going to start.*
