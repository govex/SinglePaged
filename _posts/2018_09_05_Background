# Why we need a toolkit

We saw a gap. Many calls to arms, lots of policy papers but nothing practitioner-facing with a repeatable, manageable process.

Risk based versus broad - recognizing that range of use of alg and range of impacts
Menu of mitigations
Would like to be less scare mongering given that already making many decisions
What’s the right attitude for creating better algorithms? Being foxy. “Be foxy,” as Nate Silver describes in his book The Signal and the Noise. “Foxes are multidisciplinary, adaptable, self-critical, tolerant of complexity, cautious, and empirical,” he writes. “Foxes are better forecasters.” We hope that our toolkit inspires users to be, among many other things, adaptable, self-aware, and cautious.
Nancy J. Smyth, Dean and Professor at the University at Buffalo School of Social Work, says that at a very basic level, there should always be a way for a person to reach beyond the bots and speak with a human being. “We need processes that ensure when…people are flagged for specific actions by an algorithm, the decisions are subject to careful review by a human being who has the training to understand the complexities of people’s lives,” Smyth says. “In my view this is a basic human right.”
No such thing as unbiased data or unbiased algorithms.
