### Overview
Managing algorithms requires an understanding of the risks to all parties involved. There are four overarching sets of risks that must be evaluated when using algorithms:

1. Impact examines the algorithm in terms of the effects it will have on people and property.
2. Appropriate Use inspects the relationship between the data being used in the algorithm and the purpose for which the data was collected and perceptions of the anticipated use.
3. Accountability surfaces how much involvement people have in the ongoing use of the algorithm, including whether automated decisions can be clearly explained to anyone.
4. Bias explores the underlying influence of the data and the people who helped build the algorithm.

In this part of the toolkit, you will evaluate each of these risks through a series of steps. Each step explores an individual factor. These factors are then rolled up to help you provide stakeholders with a high-level understanding of risk. The risk levels (and in some cases, individual factors) help to determine your mitigation plan (Toolkit Part 2) - how you will collaborate with your community of stakeholders to manage these risks.
