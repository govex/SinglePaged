## Part 2: Manage Algorithm Risk

### Algorithms Risk Mitigation Matrix

In the first section of the toolkit, you assessed a variety of risk factors for a set of algorithms you plan to implement. Using the results from that assessment along with this section, you will identify the appropriate mechanisms to help mitigate some of the risks. Please note:

* Individual mitigations may be useful for multiple risks.
* Not all risks or levels have specific mitigations
* Some risk subcomponents are included, but others are not.
* Each risk level builds on the previous mitigations. So, if you have a high risk factor, you should apply the mitigations for low and medium as well.
