## Background

- We saw a gap. There are many calls to arms and lots of policy papers but nothing practitioner-facing with a repeatable, manageable process. We wanted something risk-based with a menu of mitigations for each risk level.
- Keep in mind: There is no such thing as unbiased data or unbiased algorithms.

## What is an algorithm?

- An algorithm is a formula for solving a problem or completing a task. In the context of applying algorithms in civic context, “algorithm” often refers to machine learning. A branch of artificial intelligence, machine learning encompasses various computer science tools and statistical techniques. Machine learning algorithms gives computer systems the ability to “learn” from data. Machine learning algorithms learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions (sometimes with minimal human intervention).
